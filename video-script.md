Message notification: "Jack's on 15th?"

*Unlock phone and open What's Good, use the search bar to find Jack's. Show all the delicious bbq food, scroll a little up*

**Next scene**

*Music gets louder, we go from bus seat to chair seat at restaurant, see a group of friends bickering about what to get.*

Pepe: "Let's get the ribs. No let's get the bbq platter."

Alex: "Why don't we get the beans instead. I'm trying to be a vegetarian here."

Michelle: "Uh get out. Wish we could get everything, it all sounds so good."

Pepe: "Wait, we have the technology. Siri, what's good here?"

*Cut to Pepe's phone as What's Good opens up, defaults to current location.*

Pepe: "Check it, top three are ribs, bbq platter, and margaritas."

MichelleL "Hell yeah!"
